Hello! 

Thanks so much for your interest in joining Instacar team as a full stack developer!

Below is the technical test for you! Please do let us know if you have any questions! You can email me on priyanshi.choubey@instacar.in

Best of luck!

T-2
===========

We work on many of the latest and greatest of technologies and versions respectively. Hence we are always challenged with learning something or the other or sometimes simply revamping what we do.

Hence this assessment is to get to know you or put you in an unfamiliar but similar situation. We look upto you to be familiar with at least (some of) the following technologies (if not all) and show the ability in your coding and architecture!

### Frontend technologies:

* Javascript 6
* Frontend framework e.g. VueJS/AngularJS/ReactJS
* Webpack
* HTML/CSS as needed

### Backend technologies:

* NodeJS 8+ with Javascript 6
* Golang 1+
* Python 3+
* Redis or anything else of that kind

### Deployment

* Docker & Kubernetes
* or Serverless framework with AWS lambda or Cloud functions if you prefer so!

### Testing

* Integration testing
* Unit testing

**If you dont know something above, thats actually a great opportunity to learn it and implement it in this task. **

# Goal 1
Implement a basic version of twitter

**Basic Requirements**

* Ability to tweet
* Ability to search a person (using his handle to simplify things) and follow
* All tweets of the person one follows should come in feed
* Registration/Authentication mechanism
* Additional (Cannot implement all of these. One of these can be given as a stretch requirement)
* Ability to search tweets
* Ability to hashtag tweets and search using that
* Analytics

Create Register and login. Plus add other users in the backend to perform the activites mentioned above.

So this will have a database where all tweets and meta data will need to be stored. It will also need a 4-5 backend APIs and their implementation. Basic front end to tweet and view tweets. 

**It should be an Hybrid App.** 


# Goal 2

Security (Optional)
Young hackers are always around and growing. They need a playground to test their toys however Instacar can’t be the target!
Lets implement a rate limiter (redis?):
A single IP should not be able to hit your app more than 100 times per min
Integration of oAuth (https://auth0.com/), JWT
Anything else you would like to do to secure your app?

# Goal 3
Deployment

Awesome! Good work! Deployment time!

All your services should be in containers (docker).

Use Kubernetes to deploy the whole stack.(try it out, you might love it there is a nice tutorial https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/). There are others too feel free to. But if you couldn’t do Kubernetes its okay. We get it.

Write a single deployment file for us which should do everything needed to have your app up and running. Your deployment file should work on Linux/Mac at least!
Dockerizing your app is a must

# Goal 4
Happy testing!
Last but not the least, testing! You can follow TDD or FDD!
There should be a way to test the application features and functions.
Must have integration tests!
Must have unit tests!
Submit your code
Please don’t forget to write your readme file which should contain what/why your have done things in certain way! Documentation is highly appreciated!

Your solution should be committed back into this repository like you would do in a normal project.
